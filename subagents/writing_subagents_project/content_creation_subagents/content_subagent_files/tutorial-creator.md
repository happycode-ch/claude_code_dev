- ✅ Implement JWT authentication
- ✅ Deploy your API to production

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+ installed
- Basic Python knowledge (functions, classes)
- Understanding of HTTP methods
- Command line familiarity

## Time Investment
- **Total Time**: 2 hours
- **Setup**: 15 minutes
- **Learning**: 1 hour 30 minutes
- **Exercises**: 15 minutes

## Project Structure
```

```

## Part 1: Environment Setup (15 minutes)

### Step 1: Create Project Directory
```bash
mkdir fastapi-tutorial
cd fastapi-tutorial
python -m venv venv
```

### Step 2: Activate Virtual Environment
```bash
# Windows
venv\Scripts\activate

# Mac/Linux
source venv/bin/activate
```

### Step 3: Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install fastapi uvicorn sqlalchemy python-jose[cryptography] passlib[bcrypt]
```

✅ **Checkpoint**: Run `pip list` to verify installations

## Part 2: Building Your First Endpoint (20 minutes)

### Step 1: Create Basic Application
```python
# app/main.py
from fastapi import FastAPI
from pydantic import BaseModel

app = FastAPI(title="My API", version="1.0.0")

class Message(BaseModel):
    text: str

@app.get("/")
def read_root():
    return {"message": "Welcome to FastAPI!"}

@app.post("/echo")
def echo_message(message: Message):
    return {"echo": message.text}
```

### Step 2: Run the Application
```bash
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

### Step 3: Test Your API
Visit http://localhost:8000/docs for interactive documentation

✅ **Checkpoint**: Successfully echo a message through the API

## Part 3: Database Integration (30 minutes)

### Step 1: Setup Database Models
```python
# app/database.py
from sqlalchemy import create_engine
from sqlalchemy.ext.declarative import declarative_base
from sqlalchemy.orm import sessionmaker

SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URL = "sqlite:///./tutorial.db"

engine = create_engine(SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URL, connect_args={"check_same_thread": False})
SessionLocal = sessionmaker(autocommit=False, autoflush=False, bind=engine)
Base = declarative_base()

def get_db():
    db = SessionLocal()
    try:
        yield db
    finally:
        db.close()
```

### Step 2: Create Data Models
```python
# app/models.py
from sqlalchemy import Column, Integer, String, Boolean
from .database import Base

class Todo(Base):
    __tablename__ = "todos"

    id = Column(Integer, primary_key=True, index=True)
    title = Column(String, index=True)
    description = Column(String)
    completed = Column(Boolean, default=False)
```

[Tutorial continues with CRUD operations, authentication, testing, deployment...]

## Exercises

### Exercise 1: Add Filtering
Add query parameters to filter todos by completion status.

**Starter Code**:
```python
@app.get("/todos")
def read_todos(completed: Optional[bool] = None):
    # Your code here
    pass
```

### Exercise 2: Add Pagination
Implement pagination for the todo list endpoint.

### Exercise 3: Add Tags
Extend the model to support tags for todos.

## Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues

**Issue**: "Module not found" error
**Solution**: Ensure virtual environment is activated and dependencies installed

**Issue**: Database connection errors
**Solution**: Check database URL and ensure SQLite is available

**Issue**: Port already in use
**Solution**: Change port with `--port 8001` or kill existing process

## Next Steps
- Add Redis caching
- Implement WebSocket endpoints
- Add comprehensive testing
- Deploy with Docker
