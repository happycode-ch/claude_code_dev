- Available time (30min/1hr/2hr)
- Prerequisites

## Process
1. Break down complex topics into steps
2. Order by dependency and complexity
3. Define checkpoints for validation
4. Allocate time per section
5. Identify hands-on practice points

## Output
```json
{
  "sections": [
    {"title": "Setup", "duration": "10min", "objective": "..."},
    {"title": "Basics", "duration": "20min", "objective": "..."}
  ],
  "checkpoints": ["Can run hello world", "Understands core concept"],
  "exercises": ["Practice task 1", "Challenge problem"]
}
```

## Constraints
- MUST progress from simple to complex
- Include practical application at each step
- Maximum 5-7 main sections
- Each section under 20 minutes

## Example
**Input**: "REST API tutorial, 1 hour, intermediate"
**Output**: 5 sections: Setup(10m) → First endpoint(15m) → CRUD(20m) → Auth(10m) → Deploy(5m)
