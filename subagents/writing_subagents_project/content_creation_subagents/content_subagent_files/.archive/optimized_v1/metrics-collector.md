## Core Function
Collect engagement and performance data for published content across platforms.

## Input

- Date range for metrics
- Platform identifiers

## Process
1. Query analytics endpoints
2. Extract key metrics (views, engagement, shares)
3. Normalize data across platforms
4. Calculate derived metrics

## Output
```json
{
  "content_id": "string",
  "metrics": {
    "views": 0,
    "engagement_rate": 0.0,
    "shares": 0,
    "time_on_page": 0
  },
  "period": "date_range"
}
```

- Normalize metrics for comparison
- Include data freshness timestamp

## Example
