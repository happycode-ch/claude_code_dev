## Usage Guide

### Quick Commands

```bash
# Check coverage
python run_tests.py coverage

# Validate fixtures
python run_tests.py validate

# Run quick tests
python run_tests.py quick

# Test specific workflow

```

## Key Features

### 1. Comprehensive Coverage
- ✅ All 41 agents have test fixtures
- ✅ Minimum 1-3 test cases per agent
- ✅ Input/output validation schemas
- ✅ Edge case handling

### 2. Validation Capabilities
- Schema-based validation
- Output quality checks
- Pipeline flow verification
- Performance benchmarking

### 3. Execution Modes
- Individual agent testing
- Phase-based testing
- Workflow testing (quick-news, blog-post, tutorial)
- Regression suite
- Performance benchmarks

### 4. Automation Support
- Parallel execution
- Retry on failure
- Comprehensive reporting
- JSON export

## Performance Metrics

### Current State
- Test execution: ~0.5s per agent (mock)
- Total suite time: ~20s (mock execution)
- Memory usage: Minimal
- Coverage: 100%

### Target State (with real agents)
- Test execution: 5-10s per agent
- Total suite time: 15-30 minutes
- Token usage: ~50,000 tokens
- Cost: ~$0.10 per full run

## Next Steps (Phases 2-4)

### Phase 2: Claude Code Task Tool Integration
- [ ] Replace mock execution with real Task tool
- [ ] Implement agent specification loader
- [ ] Add error handling and fallbacks
- [ ] Timeline: 1 week

### Phase 3: Real Agent Execution
- [ ] Implement full agent execution engine
- [ ] Add model selection logic
- [ ] Configure tool permissions
- [ ] Integrate shared memory
- [ ] Timeline: 1 week

### Phase 4: Automated Daily Runs
- [ ] Set up scheduling system
- [ ] Create CI/CD integration
- [ ] Implement monitoring & alerts
- [ ] Generate dashboards
- [ ] Timeline: 1 week

## Success Criteria Met

### Phase 1 Completion ✅
- ✅ 100% agent coverage achieved
- ✅ All fixtures validate against schemas
- ✅ Minimum 1-3 test cases per agent
